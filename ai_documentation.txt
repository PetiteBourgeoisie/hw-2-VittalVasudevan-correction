Ai_Documentation for HW#2
Used ChatGPT for the following instances

First instance:

Input:

I accidentlly created a tag without annotating it and want to delete it? Here is the command I entered:
(main)jupyter-vittal-vasudevan---f62a747f[hw-2-VittalVasudevan]> git tag repo-basic
(main)jupyter-vittal-vasudevan---f62a747f[hw-2-VittalVasudevan]> git tag -a repo-basic -m "Basic first step for Vittal's REPO set up with the L
IGO data files"
fatal: tag 'repo-basic' already exists
(main)jupyter-vittal-vasudevan---f62a747f[hw-2-VittalVasudevan]> 

Output: 

Ah, got it 👍 — the error means you already created a tag called repo-basic (first command). When you tried to create an annotated tag with the same name, Git complained.

You have a couple of options:

1. Keep the existing lightweight tag

If the lightweight tag (git tag repo-basic) is fine, just push it:

git push origin repo-basic


2. Replace it with an annotated tag (if you want cleaner metadata)

If you’d prefer the annotated tag, first delete the lightweight one locally and on GitHub:

# delete locally
git tag -d repo-basic

# delete on GitHub (remote)
git push origin :refs/tags/repo-basic
